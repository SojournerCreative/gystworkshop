<h2>5.	HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

	Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies.

<h2>9.	CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
<p>

No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
